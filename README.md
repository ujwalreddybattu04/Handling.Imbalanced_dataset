1. Upsampling
Definition: Increasing the size or resolution of the data by adding more samples or data points.
Purpose:
In machine learning, upsampling is used to address class imbalance by replicating or generating more samples of the minority class.
In signal or image processing, it increases the resolution or size of the data (e.g., resizing an image or increasing a signal's sampling rate).

2. Downsampling
Definition: Reducing the size or resolution of the data by removing samples or data points.
Purpose:
In machine learning, downsampling is used to balance class distribution by reducing the majority class size.
In signal or image processing, it reduces the size or sampling rate to make the data more manageable or to match specific requirements.
